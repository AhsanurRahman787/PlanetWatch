# üî≠ PlanetWatch: The Planetary Defense Policy Simulator üö®

## Introduction

**PlanetWatch** addresses a critical gap in space policy: the need for rapid, informed decision-making during a Near-Earth Object (NEO) threat. Our application is the ultimate **policymaker's aid** for the NASA Space Apps Challenge, turning complex astrophysics into a high-stakes simulation.

This platform empowers users to **act as policymakers**, analyzing scientific data, projecting impact risks, and making crucial defense and mitigation decisions‚Äîall evaluated in real-time by an intelligent agent.

## üéØ Core Focus: The Policy Maker Game

The heart of PlanetWatch is the **Policy Maker Game**, designed to challenge and educate users on the complexities of planetary defense response.

### Game Mechanics and Policy Guidance

* **Policy AI Judge (Built with LangChain):** This **Agentic AI** system acts as the policy advisor and evaluator. It provides data-driven, objective feedback on the user's choices, judging their effectiveness, ethical consequences, and real-world viability under extreme time pressure.
* **Impact Scenario Generation:** The game starts with a simulated threat detected by the **Impactor 25 Tracker** (a high-priority threat feed).
* **Critical Decision Points:** Users face a series of timed, resource-allocation and strategy decisions (e.g., *Should we fund a high-risk kinetic impactor mission? Where do we allocate disaster relief funds?*).
* **Outcomes & Review:** The **Policy AI Judge** scores the user's performance, providing a comprehensive review of the scientific, economic, and geopolitical implications of their policy decisions.

## ‚ú® Application Features (The Six-Button Home Page)

PlanetWatch is structured around a clear **Home Page** with six dedicated buttons:

1.  **Policy Maker Game:** The core simulation for hands-on decision-making.
2.  **Policy AI Judge:** Direct access to the Agentic AI for educational context and policy evaluation (Built using **LangChain**).
3.  **Impact Simulator:** Allows users to define hypothetical impact parameters and visualize calculated damage (kinetic energy, blast radius, seismic effects).
4.  **NEO Tracker:** Provides a 3D simulation with real-time tracking and orbital visualization of known **Near-Earth Objects (NEOs)**, grounded in NASA data.
5.  **Impactor 25 Tracker:** A focused feed for monitoring a specific, high-risk simulated threat object.
6.  **History Page:** An educational module on historical impact events and the evolution of planetary defense strategy.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack and Getting Started

PlanetWatch is a lightweight, Python-based application optimized for rapid deployment.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Specifications
* **Core Logic / Backend:** Python
* **Web Framework:** Flask
* **AI/LLM Integration:** LangChain (used to build the Policy AI Agent)
* **Frontend/Visualization:** Three.js
* **Database:** None (State is managed in memory or flat files, ideal for hackathons)

### Prerequisites
You must have **Python 3** and **Node.js** installed on your system.

### Installation & Execution

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[Your-GitHub-Username]/PlanetWatch.git
    cd PlanetWatch
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Run the following command in the project directory to install all required Python packages (including `Flask` and `LangChain`):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the Application:**
    Simply execute the main file from the terminal:
    ```bash
    python3 run.py
    ```
    The web application should launch, providing access to the **Home Page**.

## üìä Data Sources

PlanetWatch grounds its simulations in real space and seismic data using the following publicly accessible APIs:

* **NASA Near-Earth Object (NEO) Web Service (NeoWs) API:** Provides orbital parameters, size estimates, and close-approach data for asteroids, essential for realistic impact scenario generation.
* **U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) NEIC Earthquake Catalog:** Used to model seismic effects by correlating impact energy with equivalent earthquake magnitudes.
* **Approximate Positions of the Planets (NASA Resource):** Used for understanding orbital mechanics and simulating the solar system visualization.
* **Near-Earth Comets - Orbital Elements API:** Supplements our orbital modeling capabilities.

Clarification:

We would like to clarify that during the development of PlanetWatch, our team utilized various AI-powered tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, Kimi K2, and Qwen to assist in ideation, technical refinement, and content generation. These tools were not used to replace human creativity or effort, but rather to accelerate development, improve efficiency, and inspire innovation in a short competition timeframe.
We believe that leveraging AI aligns with the spirit of the NASA Space Apps Challenge, which encourages participants to explore cutting-edge technology for solving real-world problems. Just as scientists and engineers rely on advanced instruments to enhance their research, we used AI as a supportive tool to amplify our problem-solving capabilities.
Our vision, design decisions, and implementation remain entirely our own‚ÄîAI only acted as a compass, not the destination. We hope the judges will see this as an innovative approach to harnessing modern tools in service of planetary defense and education, rather than as a shortcut.

so as we use AI for the AI assistant is this project therefore, you have to bring your AI API key to function the program.
